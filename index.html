          My name is Chris, and I have been in the professional world for around
          14 years. My experience spans many areas, including the Army, Customer
          Relations, Business and Consulting. I have completed courses for
          Computer Science Engineering at DeVry University, and completed the
          WCCI Full stack JS Development course. I have done everything from
          manual labor, to finance and coding.

          This is my next step, a step in to the world of software engineering
          and development. Please, take some time to browse my portfolio, and
          contact me for anything.

        <p>
          Github is where I keep all my personal projects, and acts as a
          technical portfolio of my work. The menu at the top has my GitHub
          link, but I want to detail a few projects below that I personally
          enjoyed.
        </p>
        <div class="github__vp"><b><i>Virtual Pet</i></b></div>
        <p>
          Virtual Pet was an attempt to make a tamagatchi style pet program that
          can be run on the command line or console. Clicking on the picture
          will link you to the repository.
        </p>

        </a>

        <b><i><br><br> St Hospital</i></b>
        <p>
          High St Hospital was a project to test the skills of using OOP and
          incorperating mixins as well as arrays. I very much enjoyed the
          project!
